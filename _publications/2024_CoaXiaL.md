Queuing delay from contention at memory controller can become a performance bottleneck for bandwidth-heavy workloads. We propose Coaxial, a solution to mitigate the queueing delay by replacing DDR interface with CXL interface, which increases the peak bandwidth by 4X. Coaxial can improve performance of server workloads by 1.39X on average, and by up to 3X.
